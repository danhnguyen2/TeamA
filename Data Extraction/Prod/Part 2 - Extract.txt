5Angela Greco Pontrandolfo, MEFRA  89, 1977, p. 50, where this vase is mistakenly attributed to 
the Dirce Painter. Most of the vases by the Thyrsus Painter found in Paestan tombs seem slightly to pre 
date those by Asteas, but Paestum 48456 (no. 102) was also found with a vase by the Thyrsus Painter 
(48464), which suggests some measure of overlap between the two painters.

Dr. Johannowsky has kindly informed me that the fragments, referred to by Marcello 
Gigante in PdP, 1984, p. 151, and originally said to come from a calyx-krater are in fact from 
a squat lekythos [StEtr 52, 1984, p. 497). The signature AZ... Al ErPACPEN is inscribed on 
the base of a column or stele. To left is a male figure in a himation, to right two women, one
